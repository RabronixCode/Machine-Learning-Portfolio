# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Portfolio**! This repository contains multiple machine learning projects covering **supervised learning, regression, classification, and model optimization**. Each project includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation**.

## Projects Overview

| Project Name | Description | Technologies Used |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| [Titanic Survival Prediction](Logistic_Regression/Titanic/README.md) | Predicting Titanic passenger survival using Logistic Regression | `Python`, `Logistic Regression`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `GridSearchCV` |
| [Medical Cost Prediction](Linear_Regression/Medical_Cost_Prediction/README.md) | Predicting medical charges using regression models | `Python`, `Linear Regression`, `Ridge Regression`, `Feature Engineering` |

**Each of these projects listed has its own README** with detailed **installation steps, data description, and model training details**.
